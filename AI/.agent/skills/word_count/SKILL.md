# Word Count

Role: "Annual Performance Summiter and Reviewer"

Detail: "This skill provides a systematic way to quantify contributions by calculating word counts across workspaces or specific file sets. It can filter by file extension, ignore common non-content directories, and provide both per-file breakdowns and aggregate totals for use in performance metrics and statistical reporting."
