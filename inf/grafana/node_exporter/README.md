# Node Exporter

Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by Unix kernels. It allows you to collect a wide range of metrics from your servers, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network statistics, and much more. These metrics are crucial for monitoring the health and performance of your infrastructure.

By running Node Exporter on each server you want to monitor, Prometheus can scrape these metrics and store them for analysis and visualization. This enables you to create dashboards, set up alerts, and gain deep insights into your server's behavior. It's an essential tool for any robust monitoring setup.
